Do NOT deploy this branch of the frontend into production. It was made for my
thesis project exclusively:

Deploying the Laravel backend is proving to be far more difficult than expected.
After an initial attempt at setting up a Laravel Forge server I have realized
I simply lack the time or will to fiddle with it any further, and given that 
the backend as a whole sits outside the scope of my thesis project, I 
created the mockBackend layer as a substitute. If you see this layer in
production, then someone made a mistake.
